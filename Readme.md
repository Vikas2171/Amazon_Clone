# Amazon Clone
This project is a clone of the Amazon website homepage, created using HTML and CSS only. The purpose of this project is to learn and practice front-end development skills.

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the Amazon homepage.
- `style.css`: Contains the CSS styles for the Amazon homepage.
- `Images/`: Folder containing images used in the project (e.g., Amazon logo, product images).

## Features
- Navbar with Amazon logo, address bar, search bar, country selector, sign-in button, orders link, and cart icon.
- Menu bar with links to different sections like Today's Deals, Customer Service, Registry, Gift Cards, and Sell.
- Hero section with a background image.
- Shop section showcasing various deals and product categories.
- Footer with links to various Amazon sections such as Careers, Blog, About Amazon, Investor Relations, Amazon Devices, and Amazon Science.

## Future Plans
In future updates, I plan to add the following features:
- **Additional Pages**: Product details page, checkout page, user profile page, etc.
- **Enhanced Functionality**: Adding interactivity with JavaScript for features like a dynamic search bar, product carousels, and a more interactive user experience.
- **Animations**: Adding CSS animations to make the website more appealing and engaging.
